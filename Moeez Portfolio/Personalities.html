					<p>
						Allama Iqbal was undoubtedly a prestigious National hero born in Sialkot. He was an outstanding
					      poet-philosopher and political leader. Allama Iqbal is the national poet of Pakistan. He was born
 				             in Sialkot in 1877. After completing his primary education in Sialkot, he moved to Lahore for further studies.
  					      He did his MA in philosophy there and taught for some time in the GC Lahore. After that, he went to Germany
					      for his PhD in philosophy.At that time, English were the ruler of India. They were trying their utmost to
                                        confine Muslims to the cages of slavery and ignorance. Therefore, the situation of Muslims was pathetic during
                                        that time. They were not offered high-rank jobs in Government.Iqbal, being a well-wisher of Muslims, tried to 
                                        awaken them from the deep sleep of negligence. He used the power of poems and verses to give Muslims of the 
                                        subcontinent a light of hope. He reminded them of the achievements and standards of their forefathers
					
                                  </p>
					<h1>TWO NATION THEORY BY ALLAMA IQBAL</h1>
					<p>
						He received his early education from Karachi Mission School. He
						passed his Matriculation in 1895 from Sindh Madrassa to Islam. After
						he went to England and took Barrister degree from Lincolnâ€™s Inn. He
						started practice in law in Mumbai. In 1907 he became a successful
						lawyer. He was very interested in politics and started participating
						in politics.
					</p>
					<h1>Ideology of Pakistan and Iqbal:</h1>
					<p>
						Iqbal was strictly against nationalism. He considered all the Muslims to be a part of One Ummah. 
 				              For him, a Muslim in any part of the world was part of a brotherly relation. He considered nationalism 
						to be a coffin for the Muslim Umma. Thus, highlighting the limitations and disadvantages of nationalism, 
                                         Iqbal gave the philosphy of a "Millat-e-Islamia" and this philosphy became the basis of Pakistan's ideology.

 					</p>
					<h1>Death</h1>
					<p>
 						Allama Iqbal died on 21st April 1938 due to severe throat infection. May his would rest in heaven. May his
                                         words continue to inspire young generationsto follow the path of self-esteem.Further, you can edit this My
